# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1:
start the program
### Step 2:
assign the coordinates of the first point to variables x1 and x2.
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
print  the distance d fromatted in the distance to 2 decimals places.
### Step 5: 
end the program.
### PROGRAM:
```

import math
x1=4
y1=2
x2=10
y2=6
distance=math.sqrt((x2-x1)**2+(y2-y1)**2)
print(f"{distance:.2f}")
```

### OUTPUT:
